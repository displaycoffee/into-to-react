For the most part, a lot of the work here carries the same concepts as in the lessons, but I did change a few things:

-   Refactored and restructure code (based on my [own template](https://github.com/displaycoffee/base))
-   Rewrote styles because I like Sass :)
-   Made most components functional (except `ErrorBoundary`)
-   Kept the search params on the left side when on details page
-   Made reusable `Loader` component
-   Likely other stuff I'm forgetting
